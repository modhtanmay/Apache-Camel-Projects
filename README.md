# Apache-Camel-Projects
Apache Camel is an open source integration framework that empowers you to quickly and easily integrate various systems consuming or producing data.

# Introduction
Camel enables the creation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns to implement routing and mediation rules in either a Java-based Domain Specific Language (or Fluent API), via Spring or Blueprint based Xml Configuration files, or via the Scala DSL. That means you get smart completion of routing rules in your IDE whether in your Java, Scala, or XML editor.

Apache Camel uses URIs to enable easier integration with all kinds of transport or messaging model including HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, JBI, SCA, MINA or CXF together with working with pluggable Data Format options. Apache Camel is a small library that has minimal dependencies for easy embedding in any Java application. Apache Camel lets you work with the same API regardless of the transport type, making it possible to interact with all the components provided out-of-the-box, with a good understanding of the API.

Apache Camel has powerful Bean Binding and integrated seamlessly with popular frameworks such as Spring, CDI, and Blueprint.

Apache Camel has extensive testing support allowing you to easily unit test your routes.
